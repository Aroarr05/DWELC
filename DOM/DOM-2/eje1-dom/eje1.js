Given these html structures, by clicking the highlighted nodes show the tag and id of:
1. The father
2. All the siblings
3. The previous sibling
4. The next sibling
5. The grandfather
6. Grandfather's siblings
7. Father's siblings
8. Cousins
9. Children
10. Grandchildren
The aim of the exercise is to traverse the DOM dynamically without knowing whether what we
are looking for exists or not.
Therefore, if the node to be searched for does not exist, an appropriate message should be
displayed, without any error occurring.
